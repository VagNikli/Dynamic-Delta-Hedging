# Dynamic-Delta-Hedging

A Python project for simulating and analyzing a dynamic delta hedging strategy based on market regimes.

## About the Project

Delta hedging is a critical concept in financial risk management, especially for market makers and traders managing options portfolios.
This project implements a dynamic delta hedging strategy that adjusts hedge positions based on changing market regimes. The goal is to:

1. Minimize risks associated with an option's price movements.
2. Track the Profit and Loss (P&L) of the strategy.
3. Analyze the impact of volatility and trend regimes on hedging performance.
