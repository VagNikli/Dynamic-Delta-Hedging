About the Project
This project implements a dynamic delta hedging strategy that adjusts hedge positions based on changing market regimes. The goal is to:

Minimize risks associated with an option's price movements.
Track the Profit and Loss (P&L) of the strategy.
Analyze the impact of volatility and trend regimes on hedging performance.
Delta hedging is a critical concept in financial risk management, especially for market makers and traders managing options portfolios.

Features
Data Fetching: Fetch historical market data using Yahoo Finance.
Market Regime Classification:
High/Low Volatility.
High/Low Trend.
Dynamic Hedging Strategies:
Time-based, percent change-based, and accumulated delta-based hedging.
Profit and Loss Tracking:
Real-time tracking of cumulative P&L.
Visualization:
Stock price trends, volatility regimes, hedging actions, and P&L performance.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure the following software and Python libraries are installed:

Python 3.8 or later
Required libraries:

Project Workflow
1. Fetch Financial Data
Fetch historical stock prices (e.g., SPY) using Yahoo Finance.

2. Calculate Metrics
Compute daily returns, short/long-term volatility, and intraday volatility.

3. Classify Market Regimes
High/Low Volatility
High/Low Trend
4. Dynamic Hedging Logic
Implement and simulate:

Time-based hedging.
Percent change-based hedging.
Accumulated delta-based hedging.
5. Track P&L
Calculate and visualize:

Daily P&L
Cumulative P&L
6. Visualize Results
Stock price trends and volatility.
Hedging actions on the price chart.
Cumulative P&L over time.
Visualization
The project generates insightful visualizations, such as:

Cumulative P&L Over Time:

A line chart showing the performance of the hedging strategy.
Hedging Actions:

Scatter plot showing hedge actions on the stock price chart.
Market Regime Analysis:

Visualization of volatility and trend regimes.
